But we’ve never fully been in control.\nWhat I like about Roger L Martin’s way is that it makes you realise there is a lot of variation from a source that you simply cannot control.

There will be gems too.\nVariability (as many of things in life) is a two-sided sword.\nPredictions\nSo, we will hate variability but the upside is such huge that the industry moves along the adoption curve. But the quality problem remains. What is right and what is hallucinations?\nI predict we will keep moving toward data-informed feature and product iteration. We measure everything.
