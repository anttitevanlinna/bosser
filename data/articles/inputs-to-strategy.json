  "content": "I have had the pleasure of introducing a number of product programs into strategy work over the last month. I also took part in taking decisions to postpone strategy work in some areas. These two have made it clearer what are the ingredients that go into more insightful and punchy strategy.\nI’m not claiming this is the on and only true list. But read on and enjoy.\nSufficient understanding of customers and the market\nA strategy is born out of understanding of the customers. If we don’t know what customers really want, then we cannot imagine interesting strategic options. If we have only little fuzzy data, then we too often don’t believe in the validity of the strategies we create.\nThe more you know in detail of your customers, the more you can be creative on their behalf.\nSame goes for the market you are on. The more you know, the easier for it is for your brain to imagine something that could stand out.\nWithout these two inputs, the whole strategy talk is hypothetical and not at all grounded.\nDecision-power and willingness to stick to decisions\nStrategy is inherently a process of divergence and convergence. You need to imagine new strategic positions that don’t yet exist. These do not come by so that the first idea is the right one. No, you need to create many ideas. You must diverge.\nThere will be many plausible strategies. But what is the one? You must converge and choose.\nYou need courage to decide with insufficient information and limited deliberation. You need decisions that stick. It is easier to divergeConverging to one strategy takes power. Let’s just call it decision-power.\nKnowledge of what is strategy\nIf you don’t know what you are looking for, then it is likely that you don’t find it. The best strategy feels often like needle in a haystack. If you don’t know what the strategic needle looks like, then you are in trouble with your strategy creation.\nPeople will suggest all kinds of things as being strategy. I feel most “strategy” workshops go in all kinds of weird directions - many not in any strategic direction.\nYou need to decide what you mean by strategy and what it looks like. My go-to model is the Playing to Win model, where we especially toy around with the two core questions. Firstly where to play. Secondly and just as importantly how to win.\nWithout the common language, everyone will think of different things. You will not converge.\nTime\nAn insightful, novel and new strategy does not appear out of nothing. The process seems to always take days if not weeks. Set aside enough time. 2 days is the absolute minimum based on my experience.\nStrategy is hard. Good strategy remains one of the big thinking challenges in business. Never be discouraged if you haven’t yet figured your strategy out. Give it a go again. Make something that could be great strategy. Show your work and get feedback. Let the work linger in your thoughts.\nSomeday you might just see the strategy in your thoughts. That’s just time and brain working together. Then write it down.\nPS: A shout out to anyone thinking strategy. That skill will not diminish in need. Many others will.",
